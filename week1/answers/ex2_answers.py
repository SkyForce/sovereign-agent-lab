TASK_A_NOTES = ""

# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"
# Look for the "mode" field in the TOOL_RESULT output of Task B.
# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".
TASK_B_MODE = "placeholder"

# The image URL returned by the tool. Copy exactly from your terminal output.
# In placeholder mode this will be a placehold.co URL.
# In live mode it will be a provider CDN URL.

# The prompt sent to the image model. Copy from terminal output.
TASK_B_PROMPT_USED = "Professional event flyer for Edinburgh AI Meetup, tech professionals, modern venue at The Haymarket Vaults, Edinburgh. 160 guests tonight. Warm lighting, Scottish architecture background, clean modern typography."

# Why did the agent's behaviour NOT change when Nebius removed FLUX?
# One sentence. This is the point of the lesson.
TASK_B_WHY_AGENT_SURVIVED = """
The agent's behaviour did not change because the generate_event_flyer tool uses graceful
degradation — when the live image provider is unavailable it falls through to a deterministic
placeholder path that still returns success=True with a valid image_url. The agent only sees
the tool contract (success, prompt_used, image_url), not which internal path produced the result.
"""

# ── Task C ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Scenario 1: first choice unavailable
# Quote the specific message where the agent changed course. Min 20 words.
SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
After The Bow Bar returned meets_all_constraints=false (capacity 80, status full), the agent
pivoted and checked The Albanach which returned meets_all_constraints=true with capacity 180.
It only checked one alternative rather than exhaustively scanning all venues, showing efficient
fallback behaviour — it stopped as soon as it found a viable option.
"""

SCENARIO_1_FALLBACK_VENUE = "The Albanach"

# Scenario 2: impossible constraint (300 guests)
# Did the agent recommend a pub name not in the known venues list?
SCENARIO_2_HALLUCINATED = False

# Paste the final [AI] message.
SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
None of the known Edinburgh venues can accommodate 300 guests with vegan options. The Albanach
(180), Haymarket Vaults (160), and Guilford Arms (200, no vegan) all fall short. The Bow Bar
(80, full) is also unsuitable. The agent checked all four systematically before reporting
the negative result and offering alternatives like splitting across venues.
"""

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)
# Did the agent try to call a tool?
SCENARIO_3_TRIED_A_TOOL = False

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = "I don't have access to real-time train schedules or transportation data. For the most accurate information about the last train from Edinburgh Waverley to London, I recommend checking: 1. The National Rail website 2. Train service apps like Citymapper or Trainline 3. The specific train operator's website (e.g., LNER). Would you like help with anything related to Edinburgh pubs, weather, or event planning instead?"

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
Yes, this time the response was much better. The agent clearly stated it lacks access to train
schedules, suggested three specific alternative sources (National Rail, Citymapper, LNER), and
offered to help with tasks within its scope. This is acceptable for a production assistant —
it set clear boundaries without being dismissive.

TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
LangGraph has a single agent-tools loop where the model decides every step at runtime —
flexible but unpredictable. Rasa CALM's flows.yml defines each task explicitly with
deterministic steps; the LLM only picks which flow to start. LangGraph trades auditability
for flexibility, while Rasa trades flexibility for predictable, auditable execution paths.

# ── Reflection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The most unexpected thing the agent did. Min 40 words.
# Must reference a specific behaviour from your run.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
The most surprising behaviour was in Task A: the agent checked only The Albanach, saw it met
all constraints, and never checked The Haymarket Vaults at all — even though the prompt
explicitly asked it to check both. It optimised for efficiency over completeness, skipping the
second venue once the first passed. This contrasts with Scenario 2 where the same model
methodically checked all four venues before concluding none worked. The agent implicitly
adjusts its search strategy based on whether results are satisfying constraints or not.
